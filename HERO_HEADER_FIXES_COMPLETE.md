# ✅ Hero Header Fixes - COMPLETE!

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed:**

### **❌ Problems Identified:**

- **Battery-colored border** that changes with energy level
- **Subtle edit icon** appears on hover (bottom-right of photo)

#### **🎯 Subtle Customization Controls:**
- **Single paint-roller icon** in top-right corner
- **4-tab customizer**: Profile, Background, Preset, Style
