# 🎯 ELLI - NEXT STEPS (Action Items)

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE (Before Testing)

### 1. Run Database Migrations
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Time:** 2 minutes

```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → New Query
```

**Run these in order:**

1. Copy contents of `database/add-condition-fields.sql` → Run
2. Copy contents of `database/create-elli-messages-table.sql` → Run

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Check condition columns exist
SELECT condition_primary, condition_details 
FROM profiles 
LIMIT 1;

-- Check elli_messages table exists
SELECT * FROM elli_messages LIMIT 1;
```

---

### 2. Add Environment Variable (Optional)
**Priority:** LOW (templates work fine without it)  
**Time:** 30 seconds

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

**When to skip:** If you want to save costs, templates are great!

---

### 3. Build & Test Locally
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Time:** 5 minutes

```bash
# Build to check for errors
npm run build

# Run locally
npm run dev

# Test in browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:3009
```

**Test flow:**
1. Create new account
2. Complete first check-in
3. Look for Elli modal with typing animation
4. Navigate to dashboard
5. Verify ElliCard appears
6. Complete another check-in
7. Verify ElliMoodComment appears below mood sliders

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT

### Pre-Deploy Checks
- [ ] All database migrations run in production Supabase
- [ ] Environment variables set in Vercel
- [ ] Build succeeds locally
- [ ] No linter errors
- [ ] All tests pass

### Deploy
```bash
# Push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add Elli AI companion complete implementation"
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys
```

## 🐛 IF SOMETHING BREAKS

### Elli not showing on dashboard
```sql
-- Check elli_messages table exists
SELECT * FROM elli_messages;

-- Check user has messages
SELECT * FROM elli_messages WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

### Typing animation broken
```bash
# Verify dependency installed
npm list react-type-animation

# Reinstall if needed
npm install react-type-animation
```

### OpenAI errors (safe to ignore)
```bash
# Elli falls back to templates automatically
# Add key if you want AI messages:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Condition not saving
```sql
-- Check profiles table has columns
\d profiles

-- Should show:
-- condition_primary | text
-- condition_details | text
-- condition_provided_at | timestamp with time zone
```

---

## 📊 MONITORING (First Week)

Track these metrics:

- [ ] How many users see Elli modal?
- [ ] How many select a condition?
- [ ] How many dismiss ElliCard?
- [ ] Day 2-7 retention rates
- [ ] User feedback/sentiment
- [ ] Console errors in production

**Where to look:**
- Supabase: Query `elli_messages` table
- Vercel: Check function logs
- Browser: Monitor console errors
- User feedback: Check support tickets

---

## 🎨 OPTIONAL POLISH

### If you have time:
- [ ] Add OpenAI API key for dynamic messages
- [ ] Test all 7 conditions (Fibro, CFS, ADHD, etc.)
- [ ] Customize Elli messages for specific conditions
- [ ] Add more milestone days (14, 30, 60, 90)
- [ ] Create email templates for Elli reminders

### Nice to have:
- [ ] Animation on ElliCard entrance
- [ ] Sound effect when Elli appears (subtle)
- [ ] User setting to control Elli frequency
- [ ] "Ask Elli" chat interface (Phase 4)
