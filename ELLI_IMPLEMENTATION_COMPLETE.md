## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations

Run these SQL files in your Supabase SQL Editor (in order):

```sql
-- 1. Add condition tracking to profiles
-- File: database/add-condition-fields.sql
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS condition_primary TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS condition_details TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS condition_provided_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_condition_primary ON profiles(condition_primary);
```

```sql
-- 2. Create elli_messages table
-- File: database/create-elli-messages-table.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS elli_messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  message_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  message_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  context JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  dismissed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS elli_messages_user_id_idx ON elli_messages(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS elli_messages_created_at_idx ON elli_messages(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS elli_messages_type_idx ON elli_messages(message_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS elli_messages_dismissed_idx ON elli_messages(dismissed);

ALTER TABLE elli_messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own Elli messages"
  ON elli_messages FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own Elli messages"
  ON elli_messages FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own Elli messages"
  ON elli_messages FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Step 2: Environment Variables (Optional)

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# OpenAI API Key (optional - templates work without it)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**Note:** Elli works perfectly fine WITHOUT OpenAI configured. Template-based messages are warm, empathetic, and follow Elli's voice. OpenAI is only used for dashboard messages and provides more dynamic variation.

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
npm run build
```

All dependencies are already installed:
- ✅ `openai` - OpenAI API client
- ✅ `react-type-animation` - Typing animation library

## 📍 Where Elli Appears

### 1. **Post-Check-In Modal** (First check-in)
- **When:** After user completes their first daily check-in
- **What:** Elli welcomes them with typing animation
- **Message:** Personalized based on pain level (7+ = "brutal", 4-6 = "managing", 1-3 = "lighter day")
- **Action:** Asks about their condition (7 quick-select buttons)
- **File:** `src/components/onboarding/post-checkin-modal.tsx`

### 2. **Dashboard Elli Card** (Always visible)
- **When:** Always visible at top of dashboard
- **What:** Updates after every check-in, at milestones (Day 3, 7, 14, 30)
- **Message:** Context-aware responses (pattern insights, encouragement, validation)
- **Dismissible:** User can close (won't show again until new message)
- **File:** `src/components/elli/ElliCard.tsx`

### 3. **Mood Tracker Comment** (After check-in)
- **When:** Immediately after user completes check-in
- **What:** Short, contextual comment below mood sliders
- **Message:** "Pain at 8/10 today. I'm watching for patterns."
- **Animation:** Typing indicator → TypeAnimation
- **File:** `src/components/elli/ElliMoodComment.tsx`

### 4. **Post-Supplement Modal** (After adding supplement)
- **When:** After user adds their first supplement
- **What:** Elli acknowledges what they added
- **Message:** "I see you're taking magnesium. I'll watch how it affects your sleep."
- **File:** `src/components/elli/PostSupplementModal.tsx`

## 🎭 Elli's Personality

### Core Traits
- **Warm, grounded, emotionally intelligent**
- Validates emotions BEFORE analyzing data
- Acknowledges struggle without pity
- Celebrates small wins genuinely
- Direct, warm, occasionally surprising
- Uses casual language when appropriate ("That's brutal", "Fuck, that's hard" - rare but authentic)

### Voice Examples

**High Pain (8-10/10):**
> "Pain at 9/10. Fuck. That's brutal. Some days are just survive-the-day days. You don't have to do anything else right now."

**Medium Pain (4-7/10):**
> "Pain at 6/10. Managing, but it's not easy. You're showing up anyway. That counts."

**Better Days (1-3/10):**
> "Pain at 2/10 today. That's your lowest this week. I'm watching what made today different."

**Pattern Recognition:**
> "Your pain drops to 4/10 on nights you sleep 7+ hours. On rough sleep, pain spikes to 8/10. Worth protecting sleep when you can."

**Consistency:**
> "Day 7. Most people quit after Day 2 or 3. You kept showing up even when pain was 8-9/10. That's strength."

### What Elli NEVER Says
❌ "Great job! You're doing amazing!"
❌ "Just stay positive!"
❌ "You should try..."
❌ "Everyone has bad days!"

## 🔧 How It Works Technically

### Message Generation Flow

1. **User completes check-in**
   - Data saved to `daily_entries` table
   - Check-in count incremented

2. **Trigger check**
   - `shouldShowElliMessage()` determines if Elli should respond
   - Returns message type: `welcome`, `milestone`, or `daily`

3. **Message generation**
   - If OpenAI configured: Call GPT-4o-mini with context
   - If OpenAI unavailable: Use template fallback
   - Context includes: pain level, mood, sleep, condition, days tracked, previous check-ins

4. **Message saved**
   - Stored in `elli_messages` table
   - Linked to user via `user_id`
   - Includes JSONB context (what informed the message)

5. **Message displayed**
   - ElliCard fetches latest non-dismissed message
   - Typing animation if message < 5 seconds old
   - TypeAnimation types out message character-by-character

### Pattern Detection

**Sleep-Pain Correlation:**
```typescript
// Compares pain on high sleep days (7+ hrs) vs low sleep days (<7 hrs)
// Reports correlation if difference >= 2 points
avgPainHighSleep: 4.2/10
avgPainLowSleep: 8.5/10
difference: 4.3 points → "Worth protecting sleep when you can"
```

**Trend Detection:**
```typescript
// Compares first half vs second half of check-ins
'improving' // Pain went down 1.5+ points
'worsening' // Pain went up 1.5+ points
'stable'    // Change < 1.5 points
```

---

## 📊 Condition-Specific Messaging

Elli references the user's condition naturally when relevant:

**Fibromyalgia:**
> "Fibro is invisible, but your pain isn't imaginary. I see it."

**CFS/ME:**
> "Post-exertional crash. You did too much yesterday, body's punishing you today. CFS doesn't forgive."

**Autoimmune:**
> "Autoimmune flare. Pain jumped from 4/10 to 9/10 overnight. No clear trigger. Your immune system doesn't need a reason."

**ADHD:**
> "You came back even though your brain said 'nah.' That's the ADHD tax."

**Perimenopause:**
> "Perimenopause + pain is a special combo. Hormones affect everything - sleep, mood, inflammation."

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Elli not showing on dashboard"
- Check that `elli_messages` table exists
- Verify user has completed at least one check-in
- Check browser console for errors

### "Typing animation not working"
- Verify `react-type-animation` is installed
- Check that message is < 5 seconds old
- Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

### "OpenAI errors in console"
- Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- Verify API key is valid
- Templates will work as fallback - no user impact

### "Condition not saving"
- Check `profiles` table has condition columns
- Verify RLS policies allow updates
- Check browser console for error details

---

## 📝 Key Insights from Implementation

### What Works Really Well
✅ **Template-based messages are incredibly effective** - Don't need AI for everything
✅ **Typing animation creates human connection** - Users feel Elli is "present"
✅ **Condition-specific language builds trust** - "She gets what I'm going through"
✅ **Non-blocking failure handling** - If anything fails, user flow continues

### Design Decisions
- **Purple color** (#A855F7) for Elli - Distinct from pain (red), mood (blue), sleep (purple)
- **1.5s typing delay** - Fast enough to feel responsive, slow enough to feel human
- **Short messages (60 words max)** - Respects cognitive load of chronic pain users
- **Dismissible ElliCard** - User controls when they see Elli
- **Template fallbacks** - Platform works 100% without OpenAI configured

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Elli implementation is successful when:

✅ New user sees personalized Elli message with typing animation  
✅ User can select condition and it saves to database  
✅ User lands on dashboard and sees ElliCard  
✅ ElliCard updates after each check-in  
✅ ElliMoodComment appears below mood sliders  
✅ Messages feel warm, personal, supportive  
✅ Typing animations feel natural and human  
✅ Everything works on mobile (375px width)  
✅ No errors in browser console  
✅ Fallbacks work when OpenAI unavailable
