## Example Messages by Tone

### Post-Supplement Messages:

**Chronic Pain:**
```
benjiman, magnesium is a really good start. I know you're trying everything to manage your pain, and I'm here to help you track what actually works.

I'm looking forward to when you get to the dashboard - you can add everything you're taking, and I'll assess it all. We can discuss further and find patterns that help.
```

**Biohacking:**
```
benjiman, magnesium - good choice. I'm tracking this intervention alongside your baseline data.

When you get to the dashboard, add everything else you're testing. I'll analyze the interactions and give you data-driven insights on what's actually moving the needle.
```

**Mental Health:**
```
benjiman, magnesium is a solid start. I know mental health can feel overwhelming, and you're doing what you can to support yourself.

On the dashboard, you can add everything you're taking. I'll watch for patterns and help you understand what's helping your mood and energy.
```

**Chronic Pain:**
```
benjiman, I'm paying attention to your 8/10 mood and 8/10 pain today. I'll be back to you soon after a few more check-ins to share what I'm seeing in your patterns.
```

**Biohacking:**
```
benjiman, baseline data recorded - mood 8/10, sleep 8/10. I'm tracking your interventions and will provide analysis after collecting more data points.
