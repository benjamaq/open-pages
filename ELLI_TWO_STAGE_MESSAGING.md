# Elli Two-Stage Messaging System

## âœ… IMPLEMENTED

Elli now shows her "brilliance" at two different moments in the onboarding flow, progressively revealing her intelligence.

---

## ðŸ“Š THE TWO STAGES

### **Stage 1: Onboarding Check-In Response** (Simple & Direct)
**When:** Immediately after user completes their first check-in (mood/sleep/pain sliders)
**What Elli Says:** Simple acknowledgment of scores only
**Why:** Quick validation, don't overwhelm, show she's listening

**Examples:**
- **Chronic Pain User** (pain 8/10, mood 5/10, sleep 6/10):
  > "Ben, pain at 8/10, mood at 5/10, sleep at 6/10. That's brutal, and I'm really sorry you're going through this. Thank you for checking in even when it's this hard."

- **Biohacker** (pain 2/10, mood 8/10, sleep 7/10):
  > "Ben, baseline recorded. Readiness: 8/10. Energy: 8/10, Sleep: 7/10. Solid starting point. Let's track interventions against outcomes."

- **ADHD User** (pain 3/10, mood 6/10, sleep 5/10):
  > "Ben, you did it! Check-in complete. That's huge with ADHD - executive dysfunction makes even small things hard. Mood 6/10, sleep 5/10. You showed up. That's what matters."

**No symptom analysis yet** - just scores and tone-appropriate validation.

### **Stage 2: Dashboard (Detailed & Insightful)**
**When:** After onboarding is complete and user lands on dashboard
**What Elli Says:** Detailed analysis referencing symptoms, pain locations, patterns
**Why:** Show deeper intelligence, reference specific symptoms logged, provide insights

**Examples:**
- **Dashboard Response** (after logging headache, neck pain, shoulder pain):
  > "It sounds like you're experiencing some headache and neck pain, which can be quite uncomfortable. While your mood and sleep seem to be in a good place, it's important to find some relief for that ache. Keep tracking - the more I know about you, the more we can find what helps."

**Includes:**
- âœ… Specific symptom names (headache, neck pain, etc.)
- âœ… Pain locations and types
- âœ… Pattern observations
- âœ… Gentle suggestions
- âœ… Encouragement to keep tracking
- âœ… Tone-appropriate language for their category

## ðŸŽ¯ WHY THIS WORKS

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't overwhelm users during onboarding
2. **Two Moments of Brilliance**: User sees Elli is smart twice, not once
3. **Appropriate Timing**: 
   - Onboarding = Quick validation
   - Dashboard = Deeper insight
4. **Reduces Redundancy**: No duplication between onboarding and dashboard messages
5. **Better UX**: Onboarding flows faster, dashboard provides value

## ðŸ’» TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Updated Files:
1. **`src/lib/elli/toneProfiles.ts`**
   - All `postCheckin` templates now accept only 4 params: `(pain, mood, sleep, userName)`
   - Removed `symptoms` parameter from onboarding responses
   - Simplified messages to focus on scores only
   - All 9 tone profiles updated

2. **`src/components/onboarding/PostCheckinResponseModal.tsx`**
   - Calls `profile.fallbackTemplates.postCheckin(pain, mood, sleep, userName)`
   - No symptom data passed during onboarding

3. **`src/lib/elli/symptomAnalyzer.ts`**
   - Dashboard AI analysis includes symptoms, pain locations, custom symptoms
   - Generates detailed, personalized responses
   - Always ends with "Keep tracking" encouragement

4. **`src/components/elli/SymptomAnalysisCard.tsx`**
   - Displays detailed symptom analysis on dashboard
   - Uses server action for secure AI generation
   - Shows specific symptom names and insights

## âœ… COMPLETE

All tone profiles updated:
- âœ… Chronic Pain
- âœ… Biohacking
- âœ… Fertility
- âœ… Sleep Issues
- âœ… Energy/Fatigue
- âœ… Mental Health
- âœ… ADHD
- âœ… Perimenopause
- âœ… General Wellness

**Result:** Elli shows simple intelligence during onboarding, then reveals deeper insights on the dashboard!
