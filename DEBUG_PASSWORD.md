# Password Validation Debug Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **CSS Styling Problem**
- ✅ Fixed Tailwind CSS focus ring classes
- ✅ Removed problematic `focus:ring-blue-500` and `focus:ring-gray-900` 
- ✅ Site should now display with proper styling

### 2. **Password Validation Problem**
- ✅ Added client-side validation before sending to Supabase
- ✅ Removed conflicting HTML `minLength` attribute
- ✅ Added proper error handling for password length

## How to Test

1. **Check if site is styled properly**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3009`
   - Should see styled homepage with proper colors and layout

2. **Test password validation**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3009/auth/signup`
   - Try entering a password less than 6 characters
   - Should see error message: "Password must be at least 6 characters long"
   - Try entering a password 6+ characters
   - Should proceed with signup

3. **Test sign in**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3009/auth/signin`
   - Enter your email and 10-character password
   - Should work without validation errors

## Common Issues & Solutions

### If site still shows as plain text:
1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for errors

### If password validation still fails:
1. Make sure password is at least 6 characters
2. Check for any special characters that might cause issues
3. Try a simple password like "password123"

### If Supabase errors occur:
1. Check that your `.env.local` file has correct Supabase credentials
2. Verify Supabase project is active
3. Check Supabase dashboard for any service issues

## Debug Steps

1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. **Check Console tab** for any JavaScript errors
3. **Check Network tab** to see if requests are being made
4. **Check Elements tab** to see if CSS classes are being applied

The site should now work properly with both styling and password validation!
