## 🎨 Design System

Your app uses a "Digital Granite" aesthetic:
- **Typography**: Inter font for clean, readable text
- **Colors**: Neutral grays with subtle blue accents
- **Spacing**: Generous white space for content focus
- **Components**: Minimal, structured, premium feel
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design throughout

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with authentication** - Everything builds from user accounts
2. **Use the example profile** as a design reference
3. **Follow the 4-cut delivery plan** for focused development
4. **Test on mobile early** - Your audience will be mobile-heavy
5. **Keep the design minimal** - Content is king

## 🔗 Key Files to Customize

- `src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage content and messaging
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Design system customization
- `lib/types.ts` - Data model adjustments
- `database/schema.sql` - Database structure changes

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

Your foundation is production-ready for Vercel deployment:
- Environment variables configured
- Build optimization ready
- Database schema with proper security
- Clean, scalable codebase
