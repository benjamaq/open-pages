# Emma Profile - All Issues Fixed

## âœ… Issues Resolved

### 1. **Journal Entries Now Match Heatmap Exactly**

**Problem:** Journal on Sept 18 talked about green/recovery when heatmap shows RED.

**Fixed Timeline:**
- **Sept 10** (Journal) â†’ Day 10 heatmap = RED (pain 9, mood 2) âœ…
- **Sept 18** (Journal) â†’ Day 18 heatmap = RED (pain 7, mood 4) âœ…
- **Sept 27** (Journal) â†’ Day 27 heatmap = YELLOW (pain 4, mood 7) âœ…
- **Oct 5** (Journal) â†’ Day 35 heatmap = GREEN (pain 3, mood 9) âœ…

**Each journal entry now describes the pain level matching that date's heatmap color!**

---

### 2. **LDN Dosing - Medically Accurate** âœ…

Based on clinical protocols for chronic pain:

| Week | Dose | Clinical Standard | Emma's Profile |
|------|------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1-2 | 1.5mg | âœ… Standard starting dose | Sept 8-21 |
| 3-4 | 3mg | âœ… Standard titration | Sept 22-Oct 5 |
| 5+ | 4.5mg | âœ… Maintenance dose | Oct 6+ |

**Timing:** Bedtime (standard for LDN)  
**Formulation:** Compounded pharmacy (standard)  
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks to see effects (matches research)

**Sources verified:**
- Standard LDN protocol: 1.5mg â†’ 3mg â†’ 4.5mg
- Timing: Bedtime to minimize vivid dream side effects
- Effectiveness window: 4-12 weeks (Emma sees results week 3-4)

---

### 3. **Gear Section - Now Populated**

**Problem:** Gear items were inserted into `stack_items` table with `item_type='gear'`, but the app fetches from a separate `gear` table!

**Fixed:** Now inserts into the `gear` table with proper schema:

| Item | Brand | Model | Category | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| Oura Ring | Oura | Gen 3 | Wearables | Sleep/HRV tracking |
| Heating Pad | Sunbeam | XL | Recovery | Essential during flares |
| Foam Roller | TriggerPoint | GRID | Recovery | Myofascial release |
| Standing Desk | Uplift | V2 | Fitness | Ergonomics |
| TENS Unit | iReliev | Wireless | Recovery | Drug-free pain relief |

**Result:** Gear section will now display 5 items âœ…

### 4. **Library Items Added - Doctor Reports**

Added 4 realistic library items:

1. **Initial Pain Specialist Consultation** (Aug 15)
   - Category: Assessment
   - Shows medical diagnosis and LDN prescription

2. **Vitamin D Lab Results** (Sept 12)
   - Category: Lab
   - Shows deficiency (18 ng/mL) justifying supplementation

3. **Oura Ring Sleep Report** (Sept 30)
   - Category: Wearable Report
   - Shows improvement: 45 â†’ 78 sleep score

4. **8-Week Pain Tracking Chart** (Oct 8)
   - Category: Assessment
   - Visual data shared with doctor

**These demonstrate:**
- Medical oversight (not self-medicating)
- Data-driven approach
- Measurable progress
- Professional healthcare involvement

---

### 5. **Mood Chips Are Working**

Looking at your terminal output, mood chips ARE present in the data:

```
tags: [ 'absolutely_broken', 'joint_pain', 'fatigue_crash', 'poor_sleep' ]
```

**Progression:**
- Sept 1-24: `absolutely_broken`, `joint_pain`, `fatigue_crash`, `poor_sleep`
- Sept 25-29: `resetting`, `recovering`, `tired_but_trying`, `bit_sore`
- Sept 30-Oct 9: `solid_baseline`, `quietly_optimistic`, `calm_steady`, `good_sleep`

If they're not displaying in the UI, that's a frontend rendering issue, NOT a data issue. The tags are in the database correctly.

---

### 6. **Why Mood/Sleep/Pain Not Showing**

Looking at line 1009-1024 of your terminal:
```javascript
todayEntry: {
  date: '2025-10-10',
  mood: null,
  pain: null,
  // ... all null
}
```

**The issue:** Today is Oct 10, but Emma's last entry is Oct 9!

**Two solutions:**

**Option A:** Add an entry for today (Oct 10) so "today's" metrics show

**Option B:** Have the UI fall back to the most recent entry when today has no data

I'll include Option A in the SQL script (add Oct 10 entry with current green values).
