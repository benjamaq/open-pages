# Onboarding Flow Order - FIXED

## ‚ùå PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

User was seeing the **WRONG FLOW ORDER**:
1. Intro
2. ‚ùå Check-in sliders (WRONG - came first!)
3. ‚ùå Category selection (WRONG - came second!)
4. Response

This happened because the user had a `tone_profile` from a previous incomplete test, so the system thought they didn't need the orchestrated flow and showed them the OLD onboarding.

---

## ‚úÖ FIX APPLIED

Updated `src/lib/onboarding.ts` ‚Üí `needsOrchestratedOnboarding()`:

**Before:**
```typescript
return !profile?.first_checkin_completed || !profile?.tone_profile;
```

**After:**
```typescript
return !profile?.first_checkin_completed;
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- Now ANY user who hasn't completed their first check-in gets the NEW orchestrated flow
- Even if they have a `tone_profile` from a previous incomplete attempt
- This is now the PRIMARY flow for ALL new users

---

## ‚úÖ CORRECT FLOW ORDER (Now Working)

### 1. **Elli Intro Modal**
"Hi! I'm Elli üíô. I'm here to help you figure out your health patterns..."

### 2. **Category Selection** ‚Üê COMES FIRST!
- Choose your category (Chronic pain, Biohacking, Fertility, etc.)
- If chronic pain ‚Üí choose subcategory
- Elli validates your choice with tone-appropriate message
- **CRITICAL**: `tone_profile` is SET here, BEFORE check-in

### 3. **Check-In Sliders** ‚Üê COMES SECOND!
- Mood, Sleep, Pain sliders
- Optional: symptoms, pain locations, etc.
- Now Elli knows WHO she's talking to

### 4. **Post-Check-In Response**
- Elli responds with tone-aware message
- Simple acknowledgment of scores only (pain/mood/sleep)
- No symptom analysis yet (that's for dashboard)

### 5. **Add Supplement**
- User enters one supplement/medication
- Simple text input field

### 6. **Post-Supplement Message**
- Tone-aware encouragement about tracking

### 7. **Profile Setup**
- Photo upload
- Mission/bio

### 8. **Dashboard**
- Detailed symptom analysis appears here
- Shows Elli's deeper intelligence

## üß™ HOW TO TEST

1. **Create a fresh account** (or use an existing one that hasn't completed first check-in)
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ Elli intro FIRST
   - ‚úÖ Category selection SECOND
   - ‚úÖ Check-in sliders THIRD
   - ‚úÖ Response uses appropriate tone for your category

## ‚úÖ STATUS

**FIXED** - The orchestrated flow will now show for all users who haven't completed their first check-in, ensuring category selection always comes BEFORE the mood sliders.
