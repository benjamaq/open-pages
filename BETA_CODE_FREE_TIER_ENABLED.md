# Beta Codes Now Work in Free Tier Signup

## ✅ What Changed

Modified `src/components/AuthForm.tsx` to automatically detect and activate beta codes entered in the "Referral Code" field during free tier signup.

## How It Works Now

### Before:
- **Free signup form**: Referral codes were just stored for tracking, no validation
- **Pro signup form**: Beta codes were validated and gave Pro access
- **Problem**: Users had to know to use the Pro signup path to use beta codes

### After:
- **Free signup form**: Automatically checks if the entered code is a valid beta code
- If **valid beta code**: User gets upgraded to Pro for 6 months automatically
- If **not a beta code**: Treated as a regular referral code for tracking
- **Pro signup form**: Continues to work as before

## User Experience

When a user signs up at `/auth/signup` (free tier):

1. **Enters a beta code** (e.g., "BETA2024")
   - ✅ Account created
   - ✅ Beta code automatically validated via `/api/beta/validate`
   - ✅ User upgraded to Pro for 6 months
   - ✅ Message: "Beta code activated! You now have 6 months of free Pro access! 🎉"
   - ✅ Redirected to dashboard

2. **Enters a referral code** (e.g., "redditgo")
   - ✅ Account created
   - ✅ Code stored in `profiles.referral_code` for tracking
   - ✅ No tier upgrade (remains free)
   - ✅ Message: "Account created successfully! Welcome from Reddit! 🎉"
   - ✅ Redirected to dashboard

3. **Enters nothing**
   - ✅ Account created normally
   - ✅ Free tier
   - ✅ Redirected to dashboard

## Technical Details

### The Logic Flow:
```typescript
// After account creation:
if (referralCode.trim()) {
  // Try to validate as beta code
  const betaResponse = await fetch('/api/beta/validate', { code })
  
  if (betaResponse.ok) {
    // It's a beta code! Upgrade to Pro
    return // Exit early with Pro success message
  }
  // Not a beta code, continue as referral code
}
// Proceed with normal signup
```

### API Calls:
- **Signup**: Creates auth user + profile
- **Beta Validation**: Calls `/api/beta/validate` (only if code entered)
- **Tier Assignment**: Handled by `get_effective_tier()` database function

### Database Changes:
When beta code is activated:
```sql
-- beta_codes table updated
UPDATE beta_codes 
SET used_by = user_id, used_at = NOW() 
WHERE code = 'BETA2024';

-- profiles table updated  
UPDATE profiles 
SET beta_code_used_at = NOW() 
WHERE user_id = user_id;
```

## UI Updates

**Field Label:** `Referral Code` → `Referral or Beta Code`

**Helper Text:** 
- Before: "Got a referral code? Enter it here to get special benefits!"
- After: "Have a beta code? Enter it here to unlock 6 months of free Pro access!"

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Simpler UX**: Users don't need to know about `/auth/signup/pro` path
2. ✅ **Backward compatible**: Referral codes still work for tracking
3. ✅ **Automatic detection**: Beta codes work anywhere in the signup flow
4. ✅ **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality preserved

## Testing

To test beta code activation in free signup:

1. Create a beta code in your database:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO beta_codes (code, expires_at)
   VALUES ('TEST2024', NOW() + INTERVAL '6 months');
   ```

2. Go to `/auth/signup` (free tier signup)
3. Fill in: Name, Email, Password
4. Enter `TEST2024` in "Referral or Beta Code" field
5. Click "Create account"
6. Should see: "Beta code activated! You now have 6 months of free Pro access! 🎉"
7. Check dashboard - user should have Pro features

## Fallback Behavior

If the beta validation API is down or fails:
- ❌ Beta code won't be activated
- ✅ Account creation still succeeds
- ✅ Code stored as referral code
- ℹ️ User can manually activate beta code later in settings (if you add that feature)

## Code Location

**Modified File:** `src/components/AuthForm.tsx`
- Lines 99-122: Beta code validation logic
- Lines 215-231: Updated UI labels

**No changes needed to:**
- `/api/beta/validate` endpoint (already works)
- Pro signup form (already works)
- Database schema (already supports beta codes)

---

**Result:** Beta codes now work seamlessly in BOTH free and Pro signup flows! 🎉
