# Onboarding Flow Testing Guide

## üìã **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Database Migration**
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor (Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor):

```sql
-- Add onboarding columns to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_step INT DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS first_checkin_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS first_supplement_added BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_created BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS public_page_viewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Create index for efficient onboarding queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_onboarding ON profiles(onboarding_completed, onboarding_step);
```

### **Step 2: Start Localhost**
```bash
cd /Users/testdev/Desktop/open-pages
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3009`

## üîç **What to Check**

### **Onboarding Modal**
- [ ] Steps 1-2: No X button, no skip option
- [ ] Steps 3-4: X button in header, "Skip for now" button at bottom
- [ ] Progress bar shows current step (1 of 4, 2 of 4, etc.)
- [ ] Success messages appear after completing each step
- [ ] Data is saved to database after each step

### **Dashboard**
- [ ] After steps 1-2: User can access dashboard
- [ ] After skipping 3-4: Banner appears at top
- [ ] Banner is dismissible (X button)
- [ ] Banner "Complete Profile" button reopens onboarding
- [ ] After completing all 4 steps: No banner appears

### **Database**
Check in Supabase ‚Üí Table Editor ‚Üí profiles table:
- [ ] `first_checkin_completed` = true after step 1
- [ ] `first_supplement_added` = true after step 2
- [ ] `profile_created` = true after step 3 (or false if skipped)
- [ ] `public_page_viewed` = true after step 4 (or false if skipped)
- [ ] `onboarding_completed` = true only after all 4 steps

## üêõ **Common Issues**

### **Issue: Onboarding doesn't show on new signup**
**Solution**: Run the database migration SQL above

### **Issue: Can't skip steps 3-4**
**Check**: 
1. Is the skip button rendering?
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify `onSkip` prop is passed to `OnboardingModal`

### **Issue: Banner doesn't appear after skipping**
**Check**:
1. Verify steps 1-2 are marked complete in database
2. Check `shouldShowProfileBanner()` logic in `src/lib/onboarding.ts`
3. Refresh page to reload profile data

### **Issue: Modal won't close on steps 1-2 (Expected behavior!)**
**This is correct** - Steps 1-2 are mandatory and cannot be skipped

---

## üìä **Testing Checklist**

### **Happy Path**
- [ ] New user completes all 4 steps
- [ ] New user skips steps 3-4, sees banner
- [ ] User dismisses banner successfully
- [ ] User clicks "Complete Profile" to resume
- [ ] Returning user sees no banner if all complete

### **Edge Cases**
- [ ] Try to close modal on step 1 (should fail)
- [ ] Try to close modal on step 2 (should fail)
- [ ] Click X button on step 3 (should close and allow dashboard access)
- [ ] Skip step 3, then skip step 4 (both should work)
- [ ] Complete steps 1-2, refresh page (should still be completed)

## üöÄ **Deploy to Live**

Once tested on localhost:

1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "‚ú® Add improved onboarding with skippable steps 3-4"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Run SQL migration on live Supabase:**
   - Go to your live Supabase project dashboard
   - SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
   - Paste the migration SQL from Step 1 above
   - Run it

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Vercel will auto-deploy from main branch
   - Test on biostackr.io with a new account
   - Check that onboarding flow works as expected
