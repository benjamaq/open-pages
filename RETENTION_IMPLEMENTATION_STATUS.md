## 🚧 In Progress (Priority 2)

### 2. Onboarding Flow Integration
**Status:** 🚧 Needs Integration

**Current State:**
- `OnboardingModal` component exists at `src/components/OnboardingModal.tsx`
- Step 1 has inline check-in UI (3 sliders + mood chips)
- Needs to be replaced with `EnhancedDayDrawerV2` component

**Integration Options:**

**Option A: Replace Inline UI** (Recommended)
- Remove Step 1's inline sliders and mood chips
- Import `EnhancedDayDrawerV2` component
- Pass `isFirstCheckIn={true}` prop
- Handle `onClose` callback to advance to Step 2
- Post-check-in modal will automatically trigger

**Option B: Embed Component**
- Keep onboarding modal structure
- Render `EnhancedDayDrawerV2` inside Step 1 section
- May need styling adjustments for modal-within-modal

**Next Steps:**
1. Choose integration option
2. Update `OnboardingModal` component
3. Test onboarding flow end-to-end
4. Verify post-check-in modal appears
5. Verify smooth transition to Step 2 (Add Supplement)
