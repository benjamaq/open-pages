          <p>I built BioStackr after watching my mum struggle with chronic pain for years. She tried everything — doctors, apps, supplements, trackers.</p>
          <p>Every app gave her more data. More graphs. More numbers.<br /><span className="font-bold">None of them gave her answers.</span></p>
          <p>So I built something different. Not another tracker. Not another score.<br />A tool that finds <strong>patterns</strong> — the hidden connections your body's been trying to show you.</p>
          <p className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-900 pt-4">This isn't a tech company trying to sell you widgets.<br />It's a tool built by someone who needed it to exist.</p>
