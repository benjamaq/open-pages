# Testing the Profile Creation System

## Current Status
✅ **Site is running**: http://localhost:3009  
✅ **Build successful**: No TypeScript errors  
✅ **Profile creation**: Works (with graceful avatar fallback)  

## Test the Profile Creation Flow

### 1. **Sign Up/In**
- Go to `http://localhost:3009/auth/signup`
- Create a new account or sign in
- You'll be redirected to `/dash/create-profile`

### 2. **Create Profile (Without Avatar)**
- Fill in your display name (e.g., "Sarah Johnson")
- Add a bio (optional)
- **Skip the avatar upload for now**
- Click "Create Profile"
- Should redirect to dashboard with success message

### 3. **Test Profile Creation (With Avatar)**
- If you've set up the Supabase Storage bucket (see `AVATAR_SETUP.md`)
- Try uploading an image
- Should work without errors

### 4. **View Your Profile**
- On the dashboard, click "View Profile"
- Should open your public profile at `/u/[your-slug]`
- Shows your display name, bio, and avatar (if uploaded)

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ **Working Features**
- Real-time slug preview as you type
- Unique slug generation with random numbers
- Profile creation without avatar
- Dashboard shows profile info
- Public profile pages display correctly
- Automatic redirect from `/dash` to `/dash/create-profile` if no profile

### ⚠️ **Known Issues**
- Avatar upload requires Supabase Storage setup
- If avatar upload fails, shows warning but continues
- Profile creation works without avatars

## Quick Fix for Avatar Upload

If you want to test avatar uploads:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Storage
2. **Create bucket** named `avatars` (set as public)
3. **Add storage policies** (see `AVATAR_SETUP.md`)
4. **Test again** - avatars should upload successfully

## Troubleshooting

### "Site can't be reached"
- Check if server is running: `curl -I http://localhost:3009`
- Restart: `npm run dev`

### "Failed to upload avatar"
- Set up Supabase Storage bucket (see `AVATAR_SETUP.md`)
- Or just skip avatar upload - profile will still be created

### TypeScript errors
- Run `npm run build` to check for errors
- All major issues have been resolved

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow** without avatars
2. **Set up Supabase Storage** for avatar uploads
3. **Add some test data** (stack items, protocols) to see full profile
4. **Customize the design** if needed
