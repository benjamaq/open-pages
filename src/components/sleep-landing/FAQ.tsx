            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">I've tried everything—why should I track again?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">Because BioStackr is different. Other tools make you track everything and figure it out yourself. Elli finds the patterns unique to <strong>your</strong> body and tells you exactly what to change.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">You're not tracking for the sake of tracking—you're getting answers. Usually within 7–14 days. No more guessing. No more feeling like nothing works.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">This isn't another sleep diary. This is finally understanding what's disrupting your sleep so you can fix it.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How is this different from my Apple Watch sleep tracking?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">Apple Watch tells you HOW you slept (REM, deep sleep, heart rate). BioStackr tells you WHAT'S CAUSING bad sleep (caffeine timing, food, stress, etc.) so you can fix it.</p>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Do I need a wearable?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">No. BioStackr works with just self-reported sleep quality (1-10 scale). You can also manually import sleep scores from Whoop or Oura if you use those.</p>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">How long until I see patterns?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">Most people find 1-2 clear sleep triggers within 7-14 days. The more you track, the more patterns emerge.</p>
          </div>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What if I have chronic insomnia?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">If your insomnia has behavioral or environmental triggers (most does), BioStackr can help identify them. It's not a replacement for medical treatment, but it helps you understand what makes it worse/better.</p>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Do I have to track every day?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">No, but consistency helps. Even tracking 4-5 days per week will reveal patterns. BioStackr works even with gaps.</p>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Is this just a sleep diary?</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">No. Sleep diaries make YOU look for patterns. BioStackr's AI does the pattern detection for you — then explains what it found in plain English.</p>
