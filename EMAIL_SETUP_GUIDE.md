## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
Run the notifications database schema:
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
-- File: database/notifications-schema.sql
```

The schema includes:
- `notification_preferences` - User email preferences
- `notification_queue` - Scheduled email queue
- `daily_completions` - Enhanced completion tracking
- `email_log` - Email delivery tracking

### 2. Email Service (Resend)
1. Sign up for a [Resend](https://resend.com) account
2. Get your API key from the Resend dashboard
3. Add to your environment variables:
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

4. Verify your domain in Resend (optional but recommended for production)

### 3. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local`:
```env
# Email service
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# App URL (for email links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Cron job security
CRON_SECRET=your_secure_random_token
```

### 4. Scheduled Jobs Setup

#### Option A: Vercel Cron (Recommended for Vercel deployments)
The `vercel.json` file is already configured to run notifications every 5 minutes:
```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/notifications/send-daily",
      "schedule": "*/5 * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Option B: External Cron Service
Use services like:
- GitHub Actions (free)
- Uptime Robot (free tier available)
- Cronhooks
- EasyCron

Set up a POST request to:
```
POST https://yourdomain.com/api/notifications/send-daily
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```
