# Chronic Pain Name Usage Fixed ✅

## Issue
The chronic pain validation message was using the user's name 4 times, which was too many.

## Fix Applied

### Before (4 mentions):
1. **Title**: "Chronic pain. I get it, {userName}."
2. **Middle**: "But here's the thing, {userName}:"
3. **Middle**: "I'm not here to tell you 'just try yoga,' {userName}."
4. **End**: "But we're going to work it out together, {userName}."

### After (3 mentions):
1. **Title**: "Chronic pain. I get it, {userName}."
2. **Middle**: "But here's the thing, {userName}:"
3. **End**: Removed the last mention

## Changes Made

**Before:**
```
I'm not here to tell you "just try yoga," {userName}. You've heard that a thousand times. I'm here to help you figure out what actually affects YOUR pain. Not someone else's. Yours.

I know you're exhausted from trying everything. I know you're skeptical. But we're going to work it out together, {userName}. Your patterns. Your body. Your answers.
```

**After:**
```
I'm not here to tell you "just try yoga" - you've heard that a thousand times. I'm here to help you figure out what actually affects YOUR pain. Not someone else's. Yours.

I know you're exhausted from trying everything. I know you're skeptical. But we're going to work it out together. Your patterns. Your body. Your answers.
```
