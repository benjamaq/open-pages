## Smart Behavior

### Action Completion:
1. User clicks an action button
2. Action is marked complete in localStorage: `action_[actionName]`
3. Button **disappears** from the card
4. If all actions complete ‚Üí **card auto-dismisses**

### Manual Dismissal:
- User clicks "I'll explore on my own"
- Card dismisses forever
- Stored in: `localStorage.whatsNextDismissed`

### Visibility Logic:
```javascript
// Show card IF:
1. onboarding_completed === true
2. whatsNextDismissed !== 'true'
3. At least 1 action is visible

// Hide card IF:
1. Onboarding not complete
2. Manually dismissed
3. All actions completed
```

## Navigation Targets

### Add Stack Button:
```javascript
const supplementsSection = document.querySelector('[data-section="supplements"]')
supplementsSection.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })
```

### Heatmap Button:
```javascript
const moodSection = document.querySelector('[data-tour="heatmap"]')
moodSection.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })
localStorage.setItem('heatmapExplored', 'true')
```

### Journal Button:
```javascript
window.location.href = '/dash/journal'
```

```javascript
window.location.href = '/dash/settings'
