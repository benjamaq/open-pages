# Symptom Tracking Implementation - Complete ✅

## What's Been Implemented

Successfully upgraded the Daily Check-In system from basic notes to comprehensive symptom tracking for chronic pain, ADHD, perimenopause, and other chronic conditions.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File:** `database/add-symptom-tracking.sql`

Added three new columns to the `daily_entries` table:
- `symptoms` - Array of core symptom IDs (text[])
- `pain_locations` - Array of pain location IDs (text[])
- `custom_symptoms` - Array of user-defined symptoms (text[])

Updated the `upsert_daily_entry_and_snapshot` function to handle these new fields.

**To Apply:** Run this SQL file in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```bash
# Copy the contents of database/add-symptom-tracking.sql
# Paste into Supabase SQL Editor and execute
```

### 2. Component Updates
**File:** `src/components/DailyCheckinModal.tsx`

**Added:**
- ✅ Three sliders: Mood (0-10), Pain (0-10), Sleep (0-10)
- ✅ Collapsible symptom tracking section
- ✅ 15 core symptoms as clickable tags
- ✅ Custom symptom input
- ✅ Pain location selector (only shows when pain > 0)
- ✅ Notes field (optional)
- ✅ Beautiful tag-style UI with multi-select

**Core Symptoms (15):**
- Physical: Headache, Muscle pain, Joint pain, Nerve pain, Stiffness, Inflammation, Nausea, Hot flashes, Fatigue
- Cognitive: Brain fog, Racing thoughts
- Emotional: Anxiety, Irritability, Low mood, Overwhelm

**Pain Locations (6):**
- Head, Neck, Back, Joints, Full body, Other

### 3. API Updates
**File:** `src/app/api/mood/today/route.ts`

Updated POST endpoint to accept and save:
- `symptoms` array
- `pain_locations` array
- `custom_symptoms` array

### 4. User Experience

**Collapsed State (Default):**
```
Mood:     [━━━━○━━] 6/10
Pain:     [━━━━━○━] 7/10  
Sleep:    [━○━━━━━] 4/10

Mood Vibe: [Pick a vibe...]
